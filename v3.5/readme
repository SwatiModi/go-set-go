Optimistic locking

One way of fine-grained locking is to search without aquiring any locks at all.
If the method finds the sought-after component, it locks that component and then checks that component
has not been modified since the search was performed. 
This technique is worthwhile only if it succeeds more often than not, which is why we call it optimistic locking.
