What
- Using a golang buffered channel, 
  maintain two copies and we do an eventual sync of the two copies

Cons
- Staleness in data reads
- In this approach, writes are blocked until the read copy is updated

Alternatives
- How to do a async update of the read copy without blocking writes? AtomicSwap HOw?
